# Truth-Tree-Assistant
A little tool to help build truth trees.

This project uses the latest versions of the following libraries: 

- JQUERY
- D3 
- Browserify (for building everything)
- Node (to build individual files in sublime text.)

To run just open index.html.

If you want to make any changes to the js files, you will have to open node and run
	
	browserify main.js -o app.js

in the directory of main.js to build everything.

For the time being, the app.js file included in github should always work.


Tested on Chrome and Edge.
